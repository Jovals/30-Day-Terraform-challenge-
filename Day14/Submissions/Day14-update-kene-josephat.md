I read the first section of chapter 7 and i learnt more about what terraform providers are (plugins for the terraform core). i learnt how to install a terraform provider, how to use provider within the terraform block, using the data block and alias to work with mutiple copies of same provider (i.e multiple regions, working with multiple aws accounts, working with multiple different providers).

Also learnt about the drawbaks of multiple providers in the same terraform code and also the drawbacks of using alias sparingly. 

I also watched the udemy videos on the use of providers, provider installation and versioning and use of multiple providers.
