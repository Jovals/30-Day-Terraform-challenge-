### Terraform Loops and Conditionals

### Task Completed: Day 10:

Watched the videos on Input and Output Variables and understood the order of precedence when it comes to input variable declearation. Also watched the video on dynamic block and saw how to use the for_each expression to make the code more dynamiv and flexible.

Also read chapter 5 of the book and understood  loops with the count parameter which allows you define how many copies of resources to create which makes it become an array of resources rather than just one resource. Also learnt about the limitations of the count parameter.

Also learnt about the for_each expression. The limitations of the count parameter is solved by the for_each expression which allows you loop over lists, sets and maps to create multiple copies of an entire resources, inline blocks within a resource and multiple copies of a module. 

I also learnt about loops with for expression and for string directive
