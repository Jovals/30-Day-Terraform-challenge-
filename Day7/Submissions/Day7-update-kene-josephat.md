### Understanding Terraform State Part 2

i. I learned about migrating state files from local backend to S3 backend or Remote Enhanced backend with the "terraform init -migrate-state" command

ii. I learnt about using terraform cloud to create a remote backend to store state files

iii. I also learned about locking files and also applying your terraform in the "terraform cloud" user interface and having it work on your cli

iv. I Learned about terraform state refresh which reads the current state of any already-existing remote objects to make sure that the Terraform state is up-to-date. You can add the "-refresh-only" flag when running terraform apply
