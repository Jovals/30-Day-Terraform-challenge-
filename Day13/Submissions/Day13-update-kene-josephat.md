I read the chapter 6 of the book on Secret Management Basics and Secret Management Tools. I learnt the imporance of not storing or passing secrets in plain text in our code. 

Learnt the different ways for storing secrets both for humans and machines by using environmental variables or using IAM roles. And also how we can encrypt our secrets by encrypting the files and the keys with AWS KMS or using secret stores like AWS secrets manager. 

I also learnt how important state file and plan files are.
